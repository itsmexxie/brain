# Basic information
- studies reactions and properties of matter which relate to heat
- energy can be absorbed/released in the form of light, heat, electrical energy, etc.
- amount of energy is specified in joules
- **system** - a part of space, divided by a real/imaginary border from the rest
	- open - exchanges matter and energy
	- closed - exchanges energy
	- isolated - doesn't exchange anything
- the perfect isolated system doesn't exist
- **state function**
	- describes the current state of a system
	- e.g.: size, temperature
	- **extensive** - depends on the size of the system -> *mass, volume, energy*
	- **intensive** - *doesn't* depend on the size of the system -> *density, temperature*
- **chemical reaction**
	- isothermal - constant heat (T)
	- isochoric - constant volume (V)
	- isobaric - constant pressure (P)
	- adiabatic - doesn't exchange energy
# Thermochemistry
- studies heat/energy changes during chemical reactions

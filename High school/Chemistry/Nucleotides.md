- monomer units of the nucleic acid polymers (DNA & RNA)
- composed of three molecules: a nucleobase, a five-carbon sugar (pentose) and a phosphate group
- the structure changes based on the type of nucleic acid
- **RNA** - contains *ribose* as its pentose and can contain A, **U**, G, C nucleobases
- **DNA** - contains *deoxyribose* as its pentose and can contain A, **T**, G, C nucleobases
